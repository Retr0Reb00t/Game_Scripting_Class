1. PRINT USER INPUT AS ALL CAPS

variable: userInput = none.


Create a while loop that checks if the userInput is not empty, is none and that it can be capitalized:

	Give the user a message asking them what they want to capitalize, allow them to input a string.
	
	Store there input in userInput.


Use string function to capitalize the input and store it in userInput.


Print out userInput to show that it is now capitalized.

-------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------

2. ADD TWO USER INPUTTED NUMBERS TOGETHER AND PRINT THE RESULT

variable: userNumberOne = none
variable: userNumberTwo = none


function: getANumber:

	variable: num = none

	Create a while loop that loops when num is empty, is none or doesn't equal a number:

		Give the user a message asking them to type a number.
	
	Returns the User's input once valid.


Use getANumber to store a number in useNumberOne.

Use getANumber to store a number in userNumberTwo.


Print out the results of adding userNumberOne with userNumberTwo.

-------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------

3. GET A RANDOM AMOUNT OF NUMBERS FROM USER AND ADD THEM ALL UP

variable: addUp = 0
variable: num = none
variable: addMore = yes


Create a while loop that will only stop when addMore is equal to no:

	Create another while loop that loops when num is empty, is none or doesn't equal a number:

		Give the user a message asking them to type a number.

		Store user input in num.

	add num to addUp.

	make num equal none.
	

	ask user if they want to add another number:
		if they enter yes, continue while loop.
		if they enter anything else, change addMore to equal no.

Print out allUp.

4. DEFINE A MAX NUMBER TO PRINT OUT A RANDOM NUMBER BETWEEN 0 AND THE MAX NUMBER ASK USER IF THEY WANT TO PLAY AGAIN

variable: maxNum = none
variable: playAgain = yes

Create a while loop that will only stop when playAgain is equal to no:

	Create another while loop that loops when maxNum is empty, is none or doesn't equal a whole number:

		Ask the user to input a max whole number.

		store input in maxNum.

	Print out a random number between 0 and maxNum.

	
	Ask the user if they want to play again:
		if they enter yes, continue while loop.
		if they enter anything else, change playAgain to equal no.

5. GET A RANDOM NUMBER AND PRINT IT ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER DEPENDING ON IF IT IS EVEN OR ODD

variable: num = none
variable: leftNum = 0;
variable rightNum = 0;

Create a for loop that will loop ten times:

	Create a while loop that loops when num is empty, is none or doesn't equal a whole number:

		Ask the user to input a whole number.

		Store input in num.
	
	If num is an even number:
		Print out "Right".

		add 1 to rightNum.

	If num is an odd number:
		Print out "Left".

		add 1 to leftNum.

Print how many times right was printed using rightNum.

Print how many times left was printed using leftNum.
