GUESSING GAME PSEUDOCODE
-------------------------------------------------------

variable: playAgain = yes
variable: randNum = none
variable: userGuess = none
variable: guessesLeft = 7
variable: win = no

Create a while loop that will only stop when playAgain is equal to no:

	randNum = randomly generated number from 1 to 100.

	Create another while loop that will end when guessLeft is equal to 0 or when win is equal to yes:
		
		Ask user to input a number.
		Store input in userGuess.

		if(userGuess == randNum):

			win = yes.
		else:

			guessesLeft--.
			
			if(useGuess < randNum):
		
				Print out "Too Small".
			else:

				Print out "Too Big".

	If(win = yes):

		Print out "You Win".

	else:

		Print put "You Lose".

	ask the user if they want to play again:
		if they enter yes, continue while loop.
		if they enter anything else, change playAgain to equal no.
